In this task I am gonna built a environment in which we assume two or more developers are working.One is Master and the other is Branch. Both developer push code to Github i.e both has push code to the allocated branches. And the task of Jenkins is fetching code from GitHub and deploy to environment. The Code of Master is deployed directly to the production environment but the code of Branch first is deployed to the testing environment and then tested by the Quality Assessment Team and if approved then they deployed to the same production environment,here we use git merge. But for testing and Production, we have to use the same type of environment.
